The Odin Project asks me to revisit this example and add UI. OK, let's do it.

I'll add, for more complexity, my own requirements.

# Goal

To create RSC game with:
* Responsive UI -- to practice html/css
* Audio FX (from the JavaScript30 example) -- to use something we learned in prev.step
* Settings -- to change the way it works & save state
* Tests -- to practice TDD

More on the features, since I am acting like the "client" right now:
* UI
** Responsive = looks well in different browsers/form factors
** No images -- we'll use only CSS to do the UI
** No backward compatibility -- not required to work on older or text browsers etc.

* Audio
** Sounds on click/tap user choice
** Different sounds on win/lose

* Settings
** Ability to change the button names (Rock,Paper...)
** Reset to Defaults button

* Tests
** Don't have an idea what to test, but have to practice testing
